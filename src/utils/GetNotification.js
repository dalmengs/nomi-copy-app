            On May 1st, we released a large AI update that made Nomis significantly smarter and more intuitive. However, a small percentage of Nomis had negative impacts. While we solve these issues, we have rolled back to our old version of Nomi and made the new AI update opt-in.
            
            If you'd like to experience the large improvement in intelligence and capabilities (knowing that there may be some instability) during this testing period, you can opt into the new AI update.
            
            To opt in, go to your Nomi's information screen (accessible through the [...] icon on your Nomi's chat screen) and check the "Use Beta AI" box.
            We are working on further improvements to this new AI update, ensuring the brilliant parts exist while being completely stable. Once we have alleviated all outstanding issues through thorough beta testing, we will fully re-release the update to all users.`
